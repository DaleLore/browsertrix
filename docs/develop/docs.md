The docs can be found in the `./docs` subdirectory.

To build this documentation locally, install Material for MkDocs with pip:

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

In the project root directory run `mkdocs serve` to run a local version of the documentation site.

The docs hosted on [docs.browsertrix.cloud](https://docs.browsertrix.cloud) are created from the main branch of [https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-cloud](https://github.com/webrecorder/browsertrix-cloud)
